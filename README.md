 Cisco IP Routing: Packet Forwarding and Intra-Domain Routing Protocols by Alex Zinin   
If you are a network administrator, a Cisco networking professional, or preparing for the CCIE exam, you may be interested in learning more about Cisco IP routing. Cisco IP routing is the process of forwarding packets from one network to another based on the destination IP address and the routing table. Cisco IP routing also involves the use of dynamic routing protocols, which are algorithms that enable routers to exchange routing information and adapt to network changes.
   
One of the best books on Cisco IP routing is **Cisco IP Routing: Packet Forwarding and Intra-Domain Routing Protocols** by Alex Zinin. This book provides an in-depth coverage of four key intra-domain protocols: RIP, IGRP, OSPF, and EIGRP. Unlike other books on Cisco protocols, Alex Zinin shows you exactly what's happening inside your routers when you use these protocols, so you can maximize your control over them and leverage their full power.

Cisco IP Routing demystifies even the most complex internals of Cisco IP routing with clear explanations, extensive visuals, and many real-world examples, configurations, and network designs. The heart of the book is its coverage of dynamic routing, starting with theory and then moving to the practical details of effective configuration. Alex Zinin also presents in-depth coverage of controlling routing by altering update flow, redistribution, and policy routing.
   
The book is divided into three parts. Part I covers the basics of Cisco routers, IP addressing, and routing and forwarding processes. Part II explains the four intra-domain routing protocols in detail, including their operation, configuration, and troubleshooting. Part III discusses advanced topics such as route filtering, route summarization, default routing, route redistribution, and policy routing.
   
The book is written for readers who have a basic knowledge of TCP/IP and Cisco IOS commands. It assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of IP networking and subnetting. The book also includes several appendices that provide reference information on IP addressing, Cisco IOS commands, packet formats, and pseudocode for routing algorithms.
